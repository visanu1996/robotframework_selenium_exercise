**Hi there! I'm a manual software tester with a passion of coding**

I love exploring new ways to automate tests using tools like Robot Framework and Selenium,
testing and coding go hand in hand for me, and I find it incredibly exciting to apply my knowledge through hands on practice.

While I’m currently busy at work, I’m always looking for new opportunities to grow. Please note that I might not update this frequently.
But I'm always learning it from my free time!! .
